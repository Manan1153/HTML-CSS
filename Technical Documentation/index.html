                <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data
                    structures and a simple but
                    effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
                    together with its
                    interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in
                    many areas on most
                    platforms.</p>
                <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary
                    form for all major
                    platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same
                    site also contains
                    distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and
                    additional documentation.</p>

                <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++
                    (or other languages
                    callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

                    This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python
                    language and system. It
                    helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are
                    self-contained, so the tutorial
                    can be read off-line as well.</p>

                <p>For a description of standard objects and modules, see <a
                        href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index">The Python Standard
                        Library</a>. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html#reference-index">The Python
                        Language Reference</a> gives
                    a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and
                    Embedding the Python
                    Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in
                    depth.</p>

            <article>
                <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the any programming language.</li>
                    <li>Good working knowledge of Python.</li>
                    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials from the
                        Internet about Python.</li>

            <header>Python Interpreter</header>
            <article>
                <p>The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code
                    completion on systems
                    that support the <a href="https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html">GNU Readline</a>
                    library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line
                    editing is supported is
                    typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see
                    Appendix
                    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interactive.html#tut-interacting">Interactive Input
                        Editing and History Substitution</a> for an introduction to the keys. If nothing
                    appears to happen, or if
                    ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove
                    characters from the
                    current line.

                <p>To get started with writing Python, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" Python
                    code:</p>
                <code>
                    "print("This is Python")

                <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
                <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
                <p>A variable is created the moment you first assing a value to it.</p>
                <code>
                    x = 5
                    y = "Manan"
                    print(x)

            <header>Python Conditional Statements</header>
            <article>
                <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Equals: <span>a == b</span></li>
                    <li>Not Equals: <span>a != b</span></li>
                    <li>Less than: <span>a < b</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Less than or equal to: <span>a <= b</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>Greater than: <span>a > b</span></li>
                    <li>Greater than or equal to: <span>a >= b</span></li>
                </ul>

                For example:<br>
                <code>
                    a = 33
                    b = 200
                    if a > b:
                        &nbsp&nbsp print("b is greater than a")

            <article>
                <p>A <span>for</span> loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a
                    dictionary, a
                    set, or a string)</p>
                <code>
                        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
                        for i in fruits:
                        &nbsp&nbsp print(i)

            <article>
                <p>With the <span>while</span> loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
                </p>
                <p>For Example: Print i as long i is less then 6:</p>
                <code>
                    i = 1
                    while i < 6
                    print(i) 
                    &nbsp&nbsp i += 1
