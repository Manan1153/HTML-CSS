                HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It is the
                fifth and
                final[3] major HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation. The current
                specification is known
                as the HTML Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
                (WHATWG), a
                consortium of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).
            </p>
            <p>HTML5 was first released in a public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[2] with a major update and "W3C
                Recommendation"
                status in October 2014. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
                multimedia and other
                new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by
                computers and devices
                such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with
                older software.
                HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
            </p>
            <p>HTML5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
                improves, and
                rationalizes the markup available for documents and introduces markup and application programming
                interfaces (APIs) for
                complex web applications. For the same reasons, HTML5 is also a candidate for cross-platform mobile
                applications
                because it includes features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

            <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or
                between websites.
                Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages
                created by other
                people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.
            </p>

            <p>An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name
                surrounded by "<" and ">" . The name of an element inside a tag is case insensitive. That is, it can be
                    written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. For example, the "title" tag can be written
                    as "title" , "title" , or in any other way. However, the convention and recommended practice is to
                    write tags in lowercase.</p>

                        <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been
                            many different versions of
                            HTML. The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an
                            official standard in December
                            1999.</p>

                        <p>This contains the features of HTML 1.0 plus new features. This remained the standard markup
                            language for designing and
                            creating websites until 1997.</p>

                        <h4 class="list-subtitle">HTML 3.0 - 1997</h4>
                        <p>HTML 3.0 was invented. Here, Dave Raggett introduced a fresh draft on HTML, which improved
                            new features of HTML and gave
                            more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing websites. Unfortunately, the
                            powerful features slowed down the
                            browser in applying further improvements.</p>
