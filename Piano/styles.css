you can set the box-sizing property to inherit,

 target the pseudo-elements,
which are special keywords that follow a selector. The two pseudo-elements you will be using are 
the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements. The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is
 the first child of the selected element,

set the background-color to #1d1e22. Also set the content property to "" . This will make the 
pseudo-elements empty. The content property is used to set or override the content of the element.

the pseudo-elements created by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty,
