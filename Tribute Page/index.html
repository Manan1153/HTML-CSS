                Stephen Hawking, in full Stephen William Hawking, (born January 8, 1942, Oxford, Oxfordshire,
                England—died March 14,
                2018, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire), English theoretical physicist whose theory of exploding black holes
                drew upon both
                relativity theory and quantum mechanics. He also worked with space-time singularities.

            <p>
                ☛ Stephen William Hawking CH CBE FRS FRSA (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English theoretical
                physicist,
                cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his death, was director of research at the Centre for
                Theoretical Cosmology
                at the University of Cambridge.[17][18][7] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of
                Mathematics at the
                University of Cambridge.<br><br><br>
                ☛ Hawking was born in Oxford, into a family of physicians. In October 1959, at the age of 17, he began
                his
                university
                education at University College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA degree in physics. In
                October 1962, he began
                his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where in March 1966, he obtained his PhD degree in applied
                mathematics and
                theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology. In 1963, Hawking was diagnosed
                with an
                early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis – ALS, for
                short) that
                gradually, over the decades, paralysed him.[19][20] After the loss of his speech, he communicated
                through a
                speech-generating device initially through use of a handheld switch, and eventually by using a single
                cheek muscle.[21]<br><br><br>
                ☛ Hawking's scientific works included a collaboration with Roger Penrose on gravitational singularity
                theorems in the
                framework of general relativity, and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often
                called Hawking
                radiation. Initially, Hawking radiation was controversial. By the late 1970s and following the
                publication of further
                research, the discovery was widely accepted as a major breakthrough in theoretical physics. Hawking was
                the first to set
                out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum
                mechanics. He was a
                vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.<br><br><br>
                ☛ Hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discussed his
                theories and
                cosmology in general. His book A Brief History of Time appeared on the Sunday Times bestseller list for
                a
                record-breaking 237 weeks. Hawking was a Fellow of the Royal Society, a lifetime member of the
                Pontifical Academy of
                Sciences, and a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United
                States. In
                2002, Hawking was ranked number 25 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons. He died on 14 March
                2018 at the age of
                76, after living with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years.<br>
